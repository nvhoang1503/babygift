With a rapidly changing baby and so much research about early childhood development readily available, how can busy parents possibly keep up, stay confident, and manage to have a little fun with Baby?</p><p>This dilemma of modern parenting inspired Vivian, a tech-savvy new mom and Susan, a former toy developer, to start Little Spark. Vivian and Susan became fast friends at Harvard Business School, and soon after, Little Spark was born.</p><p>Little Spark was created to celebrate and enrich you and your baby’s playtime while bringing you the latest in early childhood development research in an easy-to-understand way.</p><p>We know that each and every month in a child’s early years is crucial to their development, and it’s also a time for bonding. Since your child is changing every month, we worked with our panel of <a href='%{link1}' class='underline-link'>experts</a> to develop a curriculum kit just right for your child’s development during each specific month.</p><p>We love children’s products that are fun. We also love activities that parents can do specifically aimed at enhancing development. Having both together? What a winning combo! Our hand-selected and kid- tested products and activities are designed to make that special time with your little one easy, fun, and developmentally engaging.</p><p>At Little Spark, we believe that learning, discovery—and playtime begin at birth!</p>"
