With a rapidly changing baby and so much research about early childhood development readily available, how can busy parents possibly keep up, stay confident, and manage to have a little fun with Baby?</p><p>This dilemma of modern parenting inspired Vivian, a tech-savvy new mom and Susan, a former toy developer, to start Little Spark. Vivian and Susan became fast friends at Harvard Business School, and soon after, Little Spark was born.</p><p>Little Spark was created to celebrate and enrich you and your baby’s playtime while bringing you the latest in early childhood development research in an easy-to-understand way.</p><p>We know that each and every month in a child’s early years is crucial to their development, and it’s also a time for bonding. Since your child is changing every month, we worked with our panel of <a href='%{link1}' class='underline-link'>experts</a> to develop a curriculum kit just right for your child’s development during each specific month.</p><p>We love children’s products that are fun. We also love activities that parents can do specifically aimed at enhancing development. Having both together? What a winning combo! Our hand-selected and kid- tested products and activities are designed to make that special time with your little one easy, fun, and developmentally engaging.</p><p>At Little Spark, we believe that learning, discovery—and playtime begin at birth!</p>"

The arbitration must commence within forty-five (45) days of the date on which a written demand for arbitration is filed by either party.

The arbitrator may, in his or her discretion, assess costs and expenses (including the reasonable legal fees and expenses of the prevailing part) against any party to a proceeding. Any party refusing to comply with an order of the arbitrators will be liable for costs and expenses, including attorneys’ fees, incurred by the other party in enforcing the award. Notwithstanding the foregoing, in the case of temporary or preliminary injunctive relief, any party may proceed in court without prior arbitration for the purpose of avoiding immediate and irreparable harm.
