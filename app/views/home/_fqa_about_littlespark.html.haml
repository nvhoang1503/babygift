  %p.tittle_p What is Little Spark?
  %p Little Spark is an early childhood development company. Our team of experts have devel-<br>oped a monthly curriculum for parents interested in development in babies 0 to 36 months old. 
  %p With your enrollment, each month you will receive a kit that contains 2-4 developmental toys and an activity guide. The activity guide explains what skills your baby is developing that month and how to use the toys to encourage your baby to practice those all-<br>important life skills. Our kits are progressive, meaning that each monthâ€™s kit builds upon the previous month. It progresses as your baby progresses! Click here to see a sample kit.
  %p You keep the toys so that your baby can continue to practice existing skills and play with them in a different way to learn other skills.

  %p Our curriculum of 36 kits is developed by an expert panel that includes an infant develop-<br>mental psychologist, a pediatrician, an infant cognitive researcher, an infant occupational therapist, teachers, and parents. Click here to read their bios.
